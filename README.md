1) git clone the HTTPS link shown in the text box into the terminal. The folder should show up in your downloads! (recommended because you get the .git file along with it)
2) Download as the project as a zip file. Unzip the folder to get the folder!

cd your way in the terminal into the project folder and then run 'npm start'! It should work now!
